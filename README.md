Hello! My name is Maxwell Reilly. I am a jazz pianist and composer in Grand Junction Colorado.

I am very interested in code, because so many of the tools I use are open source, and I would like to give back to the community
in whatever small way I can manage!

I am currently studying data-structures and algorithms in Python, as well as "The C Programing Language."  

You can reach me at my email, c.maxwell.reilly@gmail.com.
