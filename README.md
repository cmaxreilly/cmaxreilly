Hello! My name is Maxwell Reilly. I am a jazz pianist and composer in Grand Junction Colorado.

I am very interested in code, because so many of the tools I use are open source, and I would like to give back to the community
in whatever small way I can manage!

I am currently learning web developement in the form of PHP so that I can get a servicable website up and running, and I spend a 
good deal of time working in python and bash for my compostion projects and workflow. 

You can reach me at my email, c.maxwell.reilly@gmail.com.
