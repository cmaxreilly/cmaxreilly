Hello! My name is Maxwell Reilly. I am a classical musician and computer programmer in Grand Junction Colorado.

Right now, I am practicing programming with "Problem Solving & Program Design in C," by Jeri R. Hanly and Elliot B. Koffman. My objective is to develop a deep understanding of first principles in computation.

I also use a good deal of bash and lua scripting in my regulare workflow as a musician. 

You can reach me at my email, c.maxwell.reilly@gmail.com.
